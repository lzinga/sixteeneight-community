# Contributing to SixteenEight

Thanks for your interest in helping make SixteenEight better! We love hearing
ideas and seeing what the community comes up with.

This repository is a community feedback space for bug reports, feature ideas,
and discussion. We currently do not accept code pull requests here.

## How to Contribute

- **Feature suggestions:** Open an issue describing your idea
- **Bug reports:** Open an issue with steps to reproduce
- **Assets (icons, logos, designs):** Reach out via an issue first so we can discuss

Please use the GitHub issue templates when possible — they make it easier for
us to review and respond quickly.

## Contribution Agreement

By submitting any contribution (including ideas, feedback, issue reports,
feature suggestions, or shared assets like icons/designs), you agree that:

1. You confirm the contribution is your original work, or you have the right to
   submit it.
2. You grant SixteenEight a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
   use, modify, and share your contribution as part of this project and related
   communications.
3. You understand contributions are voluntary and provided without expectation of
   compensation.

In return, we're happy to:

- Credit you in our release notes or changelog when your suggestion ships
- Acknowledge asset contributors (icons, designs, etc.) in our app's about page
  or documentation, unless you prefer to remain anonymous

We genuinely appreciate every contribution — even a small idea can make a big
difference. Thank you for helping shape SixteenEight!
